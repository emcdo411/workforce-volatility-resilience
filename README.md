# **Workforce Volatility and Resilience Analysis**

**Repo Name:** `workforce-volatility-resilience`

## **Overview**

This repository provides an in-depth analysis of the volatility and resilience of industries' employment trends based on **BLS** (Bureau of Labor Statistics) and **JOLTS** (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data. The objective is to identify which industries demonstrated the most volatility and which exhibited resilience from **2005 to 2024**, as well as forecast future hiring trends through **2026**.

The analysis leverages **time-series forecasting**, **regression models**, and **data visualizations** to explore the dynamics of employment fluctuations across industries. Additionally, we provide **policy insights** for workforce development based on the volatility and resilience of these sectors.

## **Data Source**

- **BLS Employment Data** (2005-2024): Industry-specific employment data.
- **JOLTS Data** (2005-2024): Job openings, hires, and separations by industry.
- Data collected from publicly available datasets via **[BLS.gov](https://www.bls.gov)** and **[JOLTS](https://www.bls.gov/jlt/)**.

## **Key Insights**

- Which industries have the most volatility and which are the most resilient to economic fluctuations.
- Forecasts for industry hiring trends through **2026** using time-series analysis.
- Policy recommendations for improving workforce development strategies based on the findings.

## **Why This Matters**

In today's economy, industries face numerous challenges, including recessions, automation, and workforce transitions. By understanding which sectors are resilient to these shocks and which are volatile, we can better prepare for future economic conditions. This analysis is especially crucial for workforce development programs, educational initiatives, and policy-making in ensuring a future-proof workforce. Moreover, the forecast of hiring trends provides valuable insights for job seekers, businesses, and governments to strategically invest in skills training, hiring initiatives, and economic stability.

## **Technologies Used**

## **Getting Started**

To use this analysis and replicate the results, clone this repository and install the necessary R packages as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workforce-volatility-resilience.git
```

### **Required Packages**

To install the required packages in R, run the following commands:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "forecast", "randomForest", "caret", "syuzhet"))
```

### **Data Loading**

You can either use the publicly available BLS and JOLTS datasets or simulate a dataset. Here's the simulation of the dataset used in the analysis:

```r
# Simulated Example Dataset for BLS and JOLTS Data
set.seed(123)
industry_data <- data.frame(
  Year = rep(2005:2024, each = 4),
  Industry = rep(c("Manufacturing", "Healthcare", "Retail", "Construction"), times = 20),
  Employment = round(runif(80, 100000, 500000), 0),  # Number of employees
  JobOpenings = round(runif(80, 1000, 10000), 0),  # Job openings per year
  Hires = round(runif(80, 800, 7000), 0),  # Number of hires per year
  Separations = round(runif(80, 600, 6000), 0)  # Number of separations per year
)
```

## **Data Analysis**

### **Volatility and Resilience Calculation**

The first step is to calculate **volatility** (standard deviation of annual employment changes) and **resilience** (average hires per year).

```r
# Calculate annual changes in employment for volatility
industry_data <- industry_data %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  arrange(Year) %>%
  mutate(EmploymentChange = Employment - lag(Employment, 1)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Calculate volatility (standard deviation of employment changes)
volatility <- industry_data %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarise(Volatility = sd(EmploymentChange, na.rm = TRUE))

# Calculate resilience (average hires per year)
resilience <- industry_data %>%
  group_by(Industry) %>%
  summarise(Resilience = mean(Hires, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print volatility and resilience data
print("Volatility of Employment by Industry:")
print(volatility)

print("Resilience of Employment by Industry:")
print(resilience)
```

### **Time Series Forecasting for Hiring Trends**

We forecast hiring trends for a specific industry (e.g., **Manufacturing**) through 2026 using **ARIMA**.

```r
# Install and load the forecast package for ARIMA
install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)

# Simulate historical hires data for Manufacturing
manufacturing_data <- industry_data %>%
  filter(Industry == "Manufacturing") %>%
  select(Year, Hires)

# Create a time series object for hires
ts_hires <- ts(manufacturing_data$Hires, start = 2005, frequency = 1)

# Fit ARIMA model for forecasting
arima_model <- auto.arima(ts_hires)

# Forecast the next 2 years (2025 and 2026)
forecasted_hires <- forecast(arima_model, h = 2)

# Print the forecasted values
print("Forecasted Hiring Trends for Manufacturing (2025-2026):")
print(forecasted_hires)
```

### **Policy Insights**

Based on volatility and resilience, we can derive policy recommendations to guide workforce development strategies.

```r
# Policy suggestion for high volatility industries
if (any(volatility$Volatility > 3000)) {
  print("High volatility industries like Construction may need stronger workforce retraining programs and unemployment support during downturns.")
}

# Policy suggestion for resilient industries
if (any(resilience$Resilience > 5000)) {
  print("Resilient industries like Healthcare should focus on scaling up training programs to keep pace with demand.")
}
```

### **Visualizations**

We can use **ggplot2** to visualize volatility and resilience across industries.

```r
library(ggplot2)

# Plot volatility by industry
ggplot(volatility, aes(x = Industry, y = Volatility, fill = Industry)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Volatility of Employment by Industry", x = "Industry", y = "Volatility")

# Plot resilience by industry
ggplot(resilience, aes(x = Industry, y = Resilience, fill = Industry)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Resilience of Employment by Industry", x = "Industry", y = "Resilience (Average Hires)")
```
Certainly! Below is how you can update your **GitHub README** file with the latest code (the interactive plot using `plotly`) along with an explanation.

## Analysis: Healthcare Hiring Trends in Texas (2005-2026)

The dataset simulates healthcare hiring trends in Texas from 2005 to 2024. We use the ARIMA model to forecast hiring rates from 2025 to 2026, and create an interactive plot using `plotly` to allow the audience to explore trends visually.

### Data Simulation:
We generated simulated data with seasonality to represent monthly healthcare hiring rates, which are then used to fit an ARIMA model for forecasting.

### Forecasting Hiring Trends:
We used the ARIMA model to generate forecasts for the years 2025 and 2026 based on historical data.

### Interactive Plot:
Hereâ€™s how the data and forecast are visualized interactively using `plotly`.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

# Simulated job market data for Texas (Healthcare example)
set.seed(123)
year <- rep(2005:2024, each = 12)  # Years from 2005 to 2024
month <- rep(1:12, times = 20)     # 12 months per year

# Generating some random data for hiring rates
hiring_rate <- runif(240, min = 1, max = 5) + sin(1:240 / 20)  # Add some seasonality

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Year = year,
  Month = month,
  HiringRate = hiring_rate
)

# Create a time series object
ts_data <- ts(data$HiringRate, start = c(2005, 1), frequency = 12)

# Fit a model (ARIMA model)
fit <- auto.arima(ts_data)

# Forecast future hiring trends from 2025 to 2026
forecast_data <- forecast(fit, h = 24)

# Combine historical and forecast data into one data frame for plotting
plot_data <- data.frame(
  Date = c(time(ts_data), time(forecast_data$mean)),
  HiringRate = c(ts_data, forecast_data$mean),
  Type = c(rep("Historical", length(ts_data)), rep("Forecast", length(forecast_data$mean)))
)

# Create an interactive plot with plotly
p <- ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = Date, y = HiringRate, color = Type)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste("Date: ", Date, "<br>Hiring Rate: ", round(HiringRate, 2))), size = 2) +
  labs(
    title = "Healthcare Hiring Rate Forecast for Texas (2005-2026)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Hiring Rate (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot with plotly
interactive_plot <- ggplotly(p, tooltip = "text")

# Show the interactive plot
interactive_plot
```

### Interactive Plot Features:
